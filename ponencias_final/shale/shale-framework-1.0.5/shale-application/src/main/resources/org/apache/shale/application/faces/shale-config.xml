  This configuration file defines the default Chain of Command configuration
  for a Catalog named "shale", which is in turn utilized by a filter
  (ShaleApplicationFilter) to perform application level controller
  functionality on every request.  You may customize these chains either
  by replacing this configuration file with a different one, or by populating
  your own versions of these commands in the "shale" catalog.

  <!-- ========================= Request Processing ======================== -->

  <!-- Configure this chain in your application if you need per-request
       processing BEFORE the appication is invoked.  If the last executed
       command of this chain returns "true", it will be assumed that the
       response has been created already, and that no further processing
       is required. -->

  <!-- Configre this chain in your application if you need per-request
       processing AFTER the application is invoked.  Note that the response
       will have been created already, so it is not possible to replace
       the response contents at this point. -->
