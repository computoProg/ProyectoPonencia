<section name="Issue tracking">

<p>Shale uses <a href="http://issues.apache.org/struts/">JIRA</a> for
tracking issues.  To add new issues or comments in JIRA, you may need to
<a href="http://issues.apache.org/struts/secure/Signup!default.jspa">register</a>
and log in first.</p>

<p>If you would like to report a bug, or raise an enhancement request with
Shale please do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use the links below to search existing bug reports and RFEs
      (request for enhancement).  If you find your issue listed,
      then please add a comment with your details.</li>
  <li>Search the <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/struts-dev/">Search the mailing list archive</a>.
  You may find your issue or idea has already been discussed.</li>
  <li><a href="http://issues.apache.org/struts/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa">
      Create a new issue in JIRA</a>, for project "Shale" with
      the appropriate issue type.  (NOTE:  because JIRA now has
      a project set up for Shale, there is no longer a need to
      follow the former convention of prefixing issue subjects
      with "[shale]".)</li>
  </ol>

<p>Please also remember these points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the more information you provide, the better we can help you</li>
  <li>test cases are vital, particularly for any proposed enhancements</li>
  <li>the developers of Shale are all unpaid volunteers</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on subversion and creating patches see the
<a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/contributors.html">Apache Contributors Guide</a>.</p>
