/**
 * <p><strong>AbstractApplicationBean</strong> is the abstract base class for
 * data bean(s) that are stored in application scope attributes.  It extends
 * {@link AbstractFacesBean}, so it inherits all of the default behavior
 * found there.  In addition, the following lifecycle methods are called
 * automatically when the corresponding events occur:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>init()</code> - Called when this bean is initially added as an
 *     application scope attribute (typically as the result of
 *     evaluating a value binding or method binding expression).</li>
 * <li><code>destroy()</code> - Called when the bean is removed from the
 *     application attributes (typically as a result of the application
 *     being shut down by the servlet container).</li>
 * </ul>
