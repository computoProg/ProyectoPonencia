<!-- The "dialogs" element is the root of a single configuration file, and
     contains zero or more "dialog" elements defining the SCXML-based dialogs
     in the application.

<!ELEMENT dialogs (dialog*)>


<!-- The "dialog" element defines a particular reusable dialog.  The
     following attributes are defined:

     dataclassname              Fully qualified class name of a JavaBean class
                                to be instantiated as the initial value of the
                                "data" property when a new SCXMLDialogContext
                                is initialized.  [java.util.HashMap]

     name                       Name of this dialog (must be unique among
                                all defined dialogs).

     scxmlconfig                The relative location to the SCXML dialog
                                configuration file (relative to the
                                SCXML dialog configuration file that is
                                validated by this DTD)

                                Commons SCXML action.

     uri                        The namespace URI for the custom action.
                                Note: Custom Commons SCXML actions cannot be
                                defined in the SCXML namespace.
